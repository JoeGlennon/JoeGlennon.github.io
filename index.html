                    <h2 id="about" >About Me</h2>
                        What I wish I could just say: I'm a competent developer who takes my job very seriously. 
                        I can learn anything you need to accomplish the job. 
                        I'm the type of person to figure it out if if no one know how to do something.
                        I'm not afraid to fail and fall flat on my face but I take percautions to minimize risk.
                        No such thing as not my job, I adapt and overcome. 
                        I follow the spirit of the job position and not just the letter of the positions roles and responsibilities.
                        I'm the canidate you are looking for, you just need to give me a chance to prove it.

                    <p class="content">Ever since I was a small child I loved taking stuff apart figuring out how it works and then putting it back together again. 
                        When I was first introduced to computers I couldn't fathom how they worked. That curiosity never faded and is still with me today. 
                        I've always enjoyed learning more about computers and technology and I get excited when I discover new solutions. 
                        I love that I will never be able to know everything, that there will always be something new for me to learn.  
                    <br> <br>
                    Before going to Loras College to study Computer Science I was in the Army for about 6 years. 
                    My time in the Army is what really solidified my career in technology. 
                    It wasn't until I took my first programming course at Loras that I realized I wanted to code. 
                    Up to that point I figured my career would consist of similar work that I did in the Army.
                    However, my childhood dream of being an inventor was rekindled once I discovered coding. 
                    It was like playing with legos, and I realized I could invent and create just about anything with code. 
                    My favorite thing about coding is the feeling I get when I finally solve a challenge that has stumped me. 
                    Whether it's a bug in the code or creating a tricky function or algorithm.
                    
                        <br> <br>
                    I value honesty, loyalty, integrity, and respect above all else and I try my best to always live by those values.
                        <br> <br>
                    Outside of work I enjoy board games, video games, anime, hiking, karate, traveling, and hanging out with friends.

                                    The game generates a 4 letter code and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it correctly.
                                    After each guess the player is given a hint about its correctness.

                                    This project is my replication of one of my favorite board games, <i>Camel Up</i>. 
                                    The program is almost an exact copy of the original game with one or two differences. 
                                    This project was originally done in C++ utilizing the console for display and interaction. 
                                    After learning JavaScript better I thought it would be fun to rebuild the game with an actual GUI. 
                                    The program works and a full game can be played. However, it could still use more debugging and updates.

                                    This project was my senior capstone project at Loras College. 
                                    The school's Planetarium needed a reservation system for showings. 
                                    My team and I took on the task of creating a ticketing website where patrons could see upcoming showings, 
                                    make reservations, and receive ticket stubs. 
                                    Additionally, the site needed to meet the needs of the faculty and staff that run and maintain the Planetarium. 
                                    So a non-public management side of the site was also created so faculty could adjust all public-facing content easily.

                        As a child and even currently I have these great ideas but not the means to plan and execute them. 
                        Growing up I would always have an idea and I would sketch it in a notebook. 
                        Eventually I would see an advertisement for something very similar to my idea, 
                        giving me the encouragement that my ideas are not just realistic but also profitable.
